Ok so basically, its like 25 oct,, 10:50 pm... Ive started the work lmao, but y'all need consistent commits I js realized, so yuh that's what this .txt file is for.... Almost decided on idea

yo! here's a few random ideas lol: 1.live betting on nba games, normal bets are of the form who wins, does luka score over 30 etc... this is going to be more small bets of the form who scores the next point? how is the next point scored? (or cricket games too lol) 2.wager system between friends; or random people online talk and are like i bet ill defeat oyu in chess and then they play with a wager. friends like ill defeat oyu in fortnite and they play with a wager system. 3. productivity app with money punishment.. i have deposited some money in the app, then i say i will commpletely study chapter 2 of diestel today, then at the end of the day, i will use an llm as a judge to test me on it, and see if i actually learnt it. if i didnt, the stake is lost. or i say im going to complete building this feature tonight, at the end of the night, again llm as a judge tests me (so i guess sorta like the pumproyale idea lmao)
