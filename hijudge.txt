Ok so basically, its like 25 oct,, 10:50 pm... Ive started the work lmao, but y'all need consistent commits I js realized, so yuh that's what this .txt file is for.... Almost decided on idea

yo! here's a few random ideas lol: 1.live betting on nba games, normal bets are of the form who wins, does luka score over 30 etc... this is going to be more small bets of the form who scores the next point? how is the next point scored? (or cricket games too lol) 2.wager system between friends; or random people online talk and are like i bet ill defeat oyu in chess and then they play with a wager. friends like ill defeat oyu in fortnite and they play with a wager system. 3. productivity app with money punishment.. i have deposited some money in the app, then i say i will commpletely study chapter 2 of diestel today, then at the end of the day, i will use an llm as a judge to test me on it, and see if i actually learnt it. if i didnt, the stake is lost. or i say im going to complete building this feature tonight, at the end of the night, again llm as a judge tests me (so i guess sorta like the pumproyale idea lmao)

pay for stuff with paytm

the best experience for me was when we were playing 7 up 7 down, with like keeping on giving money etc etc... something fun like that... live betting on nba games, who scores the next point type shit. 


wtf dares is actually cool as fuck

productivity is cool when i can tell people im going to do something and then i do it. so a social app, where everyone has a profile and everyday they say a bunch of stuff like their goals etc. and then llm as a judge tests whether they accomplished those, maybe losers money goes to winners pool. orm maybe losers money helps pay for llm (or wait llm you can just use your own account llm right lol) and then you have a record of the whole day of each person, on the blockchain (and you can store also the llm chats) i mean ofc you can cheat also but wtv ignore that for now. then your whole life and proof of you achieving your goals is on the blockchain, kind of a social profile too, where you have a social profile (linking to twitter might be fun, cos on twitter people claim a bunch of stuff and they can have sort of blockchain proof of i accomplished this today). so you can look people up, see ok this guy is working hard achieving his goals daily, this guy is learning so much stuff daily wow

ok this dareboard idea i have is actually very fun lol... 
and the chess wager thing is there. looks easy to build... if i cant implement cool things, ill just do chess wager...
